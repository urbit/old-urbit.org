Thought we'd share the following email that we sent out on the developers
mailing list (urbit-dev@googlegroups.org):

>Welcome to Urbit! You've been added to this mailing list because you all are
>now proud owners of one or more destroyers (let us know if you're not and
>we'll remedy that). We'll be using this list to update all of you with the
>latest news from the offworld colonies. Presently your subscription settings
>are at one digest email daily (we have a powerful hatred of listserv-spam).
>Feel free to change these settings on Google Groups to whatever you like.

>Our target date for network continuity is Friday October 4th. At which point
>the data structures we create will (if we succeed) live forever. We'll almost
>certainly do at least one reboot sometime before then, so you'll have to
>recreate your destroyers from your keys when we do.

>Also, we plan on putting up some actual Hoon doc by then, so you all can, you
>know, actually learn Hoon.

>I'll leave you with some Borges: "Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at
>times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope." 

Since this blog post is not limited to 1000 words (seriously Google) and
because I love that quote so damn much, I'll post the whole thing:

>"In the most ancient regions of Tlön, the duplication of lost objects is not
>infrequent. Two persons look for a pencil; the first finds it and says nothing;
>the second finds a second pencil, no less real, but closer to his expectations.
>These secondary objects are called hronir and are, though awkward in form,
>somewhat longer. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental products of
>distraction and forgetfulness. It seems unbelievable that their methodical
>production dates back scarcely a hundred years, but this is what the Eleventh
>Volume tells us.

>[...]

>The methodical fabrication of hronir (says the Eleventh Volume) has performed
>prodigious services for archaeologists.  It has made possible the interrogation
>and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile
>than the future. Curiously, the hronir of second and third degree - the hronir
>derived from another hron, those derived from the hron of a hron - exaggerate
>the aberrations of the initial one; those of fifth degree are almost uniform;
>those of ninth degree become confused with those of the second; in those of the
>eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original. The process is
>cyclical: the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in quality.
>Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced
>through suggestion, educed by hope."
